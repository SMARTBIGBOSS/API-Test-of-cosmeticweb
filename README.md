# Assignment 1 - API testing and Source Control.

Name: Anqi Li 

## Overview.

The full name of API is Application Programming Interfaces. It is interfaces between the program and the users. Users do not need to read the source code and know how the program run. They interact with the program by APIs. In this program, it allows users to sign up and login as sellers or customers by special APIs. They can also use APIs which are designed by developer to view and update information including account information, cosmetic information and transaction information. The purpose of these APIs is to provide a easy and clear way for users to use this program. Besides, using API is a good way to encapsulate code.
